This project is a Word Puzzle Game created using the Pygame library, designed to engage users in a fun and interactive experience of forming words from a set of given letters. The main features of the game include:

Gameplay Mechanics:

Players select letters to form valid words based on a predefined word list.
Correctly guessed words earn points, while incorrect guesses play a "wrong" sound effect.
An undo feature allows players to revert their last selection, and a clear button resets all selected letters.
Hints are available to assist players.
Graphical and Audio Elements:

The game features visually appealing backgrounds and animated interfaces.
Background music plays continuously, and sound effects are triggered for actions like button clicks, correct, or wrong guesses.
Timers and Scoring:

A countdown timer creates urgency, and players need to form as many words as possible before time runs out.
A score counter tracks progress, with each correct word adding points.
Coupon Rewards:

Based on their performance, players can win discount coupons (e.g., 75%, 50%, or 25% off).
Winners and their achievements are recorded in a file (winners.txt) for tracking and reference.
Interactive User Experience:

Players input their name at the start of the game.
The name is checked for uniqueness to ensure no duplicates in the winners' record.
Code Features:

Organized with separate functions for specific tasks like drawing UI components, handling user input, and updating game logic.
Includes dynamic layout calculations, animations, and efficient event handling.
This project is a blend of education and entertainment, designed for players to test their vocabulary skills while enjoying an immersive gaming experience.
